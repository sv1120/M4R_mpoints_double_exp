# M4R_mpoints_double_exp
mpoints extension with double exponential kernel capacity (instead of single)

Note that a single-exponential kernel simulation can still be obtained from this module by setting the second set of impact coefficients to 0, but the estimate hawkes parameters function is unlikely to converge in this case.
